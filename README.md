I am an Entry-level IT professional with a passion for systems, troubleshooting, and cybersecurity. This GitHub contains technical documentation, hands-on labs, and tools I've created or explored as I transition into the field.

## Objective
My journey in technology began with hands-on experience building and repairing computers, which sparked a lasting interest in IT systems and security. After earning certifications in Google IT Support, Google Cybersecurity, and CompTIA Security+, Iâ€™ve made the transition into the IT field with a focus on practical support and security operations. I'm now actively pursuing opportunities to apply my skills in a professional setting and specifically aiming to grow into a Tier 1 SOC Analyst or IT Support role where I can contribute to threat detection, system hardening, and end-user support.
