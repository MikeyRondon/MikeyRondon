I’m an entry-level IT and cybersecurity professional actively building hands-on skills through a structured home lab. This GitHub showcases my training progress, including lab setups, threat detection exercises, and documentation of tools I’m learning like Wireshark, Wazuh, and Sysmon.

## 🎯 Objective

My journey in technology began with hands-on experience building and repairing computers, which sparked a lasting interest in IT systems and security. After earning certifications in Google IT Support, Google Cybersecurity, and CompTIA Security+, I’ve transitioned into IT with a focus on practical support and security operations. I'm now actively pursuing opportunities in Tier 1 SOC Analyst and IT Support roles where I can contribute to threat detection, system hardening, and end-user support.
