I am an entry-level IT professional with a passion for systems, troubleshooting, and cybersecurity. This GitHub contains technical documentation, hands-on labs, and tools I've explored as I transition into the field.

## 🎯 Objective

My journey in technology began with hands-on experience building and repairing computers, which sparked a lasting interest in IT systems and security. After earning certifications in Google IT Support, Google Cybersecurity, and CompTIA Security+, I’ve transitioned into IT with a focus on practical support and security operations. I'm now actively pursuing opportunities in Tier 1 SOC Analyst and IT Support roles where I can contribute to threat detection, system hardening, and end-user support.
